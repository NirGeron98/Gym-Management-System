# Gym-Management-System
As part of an advanced programming course in C language in my computer science degree, I built a gym management system whose purpose is to provide all the information needed to manage the place and reflect a broad picture of the activity in the various departments in the gym as well as making managerial decisions accordingly.

As part of the options in the management department, you can add/delete/update main components in the system. For example: employees, trainees, workout, equipments...

In the "Finances and Data" department, you can view all the institute's financial information (revenues/expenses/profits) and even view in real time the address of the institute and the number of trainees and employees.

The gym has a shop that sells various products for trainees. The management of the place can receive all the information about the products in stock and the number of purchases made for each product, and make changes accordingly such as: removing a product, restocking, raising prices, etc.
